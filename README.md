Description:
In this project, I have developed 18 neuron based Nueal Network to predict wheather a patient has possibility to be affected by Covid-19 or not. Realtime Dataset was provided by Pucho Life Science Inc. Applied Artifitial Neural Network with Relu and Sigmoid activation fuction in 3 layes.



Method:
1. Data Collection: Realtime dataset provided by Pucho Life Science Inc, India. Dataset Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data/master/combined_data.csv.
3. Pre-processing: Encoding with Map function, Missing Data Handling, Feature Selection.
4. Algorithm: Applied Artifitial Neural Network. Used 12 neurons and Relu Activation fuction with 4 dimentional input layer. Used 4 neuron based hidden layer with same activation fuction. Output layer contains 2 neurons with Sigmoid Activation function. Trained in 100 epochs with a batch size 300. 
5. Evaluation: Evaluated the model with Accuracy metrics. Achieved accuracy is upto 85%.



Limitations:
1. Poor datapreparation techniques has been applied.
2. Low accuracy beacause of complex data,poor data preparation, no hyperparemetertuning, etc



Future Work:
1. I am currently working on Health Informatics related problems. I'll update the existing model after September.
